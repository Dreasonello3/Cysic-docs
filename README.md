# Cysic Overview
## A New Approach to Designing ZK-ASICs: The zkVM Way

As the validation team Dreasonello3, we are excited to share our involvement in the Cysic project, an innovative endeavor focused on hardware acceleration for zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) generation. In this blog, we explore how the adoption of zkVM (zero-knowledge virtual machine) not only simplifies the design of ZK-ASICs but also significantly enhances their performance and cost-efficiency.

### Introduction to ZKPs and Their Challenges

Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) are powerful cryptographic protocols that allow a prover to convince a verifier that a statement is true without revealing any information beyond the validity of the statement. This revolutionary concept has found applications in privacy-preserving transactions, blockchain scalability, and secure verification of complex computations.

However, generating ZK proofs remains resource-intensive. Current solutions require substantial computational power and time, which has limited their wider adoption. For instance, creating proofs for ZK-EVM circuits or machine learning models like GPT-2 can demand enormous resources, such as high-performance CPUs with hundreds of gigabytes of RAM.

To address these challenges, the Cysic team is exploring innovative hardware solutions, including specialized ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits) designed for ZK computation. Our goal is to develop more efficient and cost-effective hardware that can meet the growing demands of ZKP generation.

### ZK Hardware Acceleration: Current Landscape

In ZKP hardware acceleration, various hardware types — CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and ASICs — can be used. Each option has its advantages and limitations:

- CPUs are the baseline for comparison but offer relatively limited performance for ZKP tasks.
  
- GPUs provide better parallelization but require advanced CUDA programming and are not optimized for ZK-specific operations.
  
- FPGAs offer a customizable middle ground between CPUs and ASICs, allowing for more specialized computation but with higher complexity.
  
- ASICs are highly specialized chips designed for specific tasks, offering unparalleled performance per dollar and watt.
  
Cysic’s research has shown that while using FPGAs in combination with CPUs improves performance, it falls short of the real-time ZKP generation needed for large-scale applications. This is where the new zkVM paradigm comes into play.

### Introducing zkVM: The Key to Efficient ZK-ASIC Design

A zkVM (zero-knowledge virtual machine) is a virtual machine optimized for running ZK proofs. It’s designed to handle various ZK circuits by supporting a wide range of computational operations. The zkVM approach can overcome many of the limitations associated with traditional hardware designs for ZKP generation.

### Why zkVM is a Game-Changer

1. Instruction Flexibility: zkVMs support customizable instruction sets, making them adaptable for different ZK applications, from Ethereum smart contracts to complex machine learning models.

2. Parallel Processing: The segmentation feature in zkVMs allows for splitting large computations into smaller parts, which can be processed independently and in parallel. This is ideal for hardware optimization, as it reduces communication costs between different hardware components.

3. Lower Bandwidth and Memory Requirements: zkVMs reduce the I/O bandwidth needed for proof generation, making the process more efficient even with limited hardware resources. By controlling memory requirements, zkVM can adapt to various hardware designs without sacrificing performance.

### Cysic’s zkVM-Based Hardware Design

Cysic’s zkVM-based architecture focuses on creating a flexible and scalable system for ZK proof generation. The design includes:

- A **programmable vector machine** for efficient vector operations.
  
- **Specialized modules** for essential ZK computations like number-theoretic transform (NTT), multi-scalar multiplication (MSM), and polynomial evaluations.
  
- **Configurable hash function units** optimized for ZK field operations.
  
This flexible architecture allows for various hardware configurations, from portable devices to enterprise-grade solutions, offering performance improvements across a wide range of use cases.

### Conclusion: A Call for Collaboration

Cysic’s zkVM-based approach represents a new paradigm in ZK hardware design, offering a more efficient and cost-effective solution for generating ZK proofs in real time. We believe that this innovation will unlock new possibilities in blockchain scalability, privacy, and beyond.

We invite the community to collaborate with us as we continue to refine our zkVM-based hardware design. With input from diverse perspectives and new ideas, we can push the boundaries of what’s possible in zero-knowledge proof technology.

Let’s work together to build the future of ZK-ASICs!
